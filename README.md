# Fantasy Premier League Website

**Hello!**

This is my second major project that I have created on my own.

The site is dedicated to the theme of the game Fantasy Premier League.
On it you will find a story about me, instructions on how to start the game, tips, contact form.

On the page you will find a **table with recommended players in two options**, which you can change with a button.
In the News panel, there is a **Twitter widget** from which you can view the latest twits.
You also have the option to **vote for a player in a poll**.

The site is fully responsive. You can use it on larger as well as smaller resolutions.
